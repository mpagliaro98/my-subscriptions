This is a work-in-progress personal project for Android, which when
complete will allow the user to input and keep track of online
subscriptions, set notifications and reminders for when payments are
coming up, and view general analytics on all subscriptions. As this
is still a work-in-progress, and this is allowing me to learn Android
app development, this code will likely not be entirely neat and clean
until a bit later on as I learn and test out new functionality that
will help realize my vision for this project. Along with that, I am not
experienced enough with Gradle to provide accurate instructions to
those wishing to download and run the app in its current state. Once
the app is complete, I do have plans to have it downloadable for
anybody to use.
