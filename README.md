# MySubscriptions

Author: Michael Pagliaro

This is a work-in-progress personal project for Android, which when
complete will allow the user to input and keep track of online
subscriptions, set notifications and reminders when payments are
coming up, and view general analytics on all subscriptions. As this
is still a work-in-progress, and this is allowing me to learn Android
app development, this code will likely not be entirely neat and clean
until a bit later on as I learn and test out new functionality that
will help realize my vision for this project.

## Planned Features

* Home Tab
    * Add a new subscription (contains fields for name, price, how often it's charged, notes, category, etc)
    * List all subscriptions on the home page
    * Allow editing or deleting of subscriptions
    * Set notifications to display when payments are coming up
* Calendar Tab
    * Show an interactive calendar of when each upcoming payment is
    * Allow syncing with other calendar apps
* Analytics Tab
    * Display how much is being paid within a certain timespan
    * Allow sorting of costs by category, time, and others
